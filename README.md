# Tender API Project

## Project Overview
The essence of this project is to use an **API** from a website that provides information about various tenders and their details.  
The goal is to **retrieve, process, and store** this data in a database, which can, for example, be deployed using a **Docker container**.

## System Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

1. **Database Layer**  
   - Stores the processed tender data.  
   - Supports **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  

2. **Backend (Controller Module)**  
   - Acts as an intermediary between the database and other components.  
   - Handles data retrieval, modification, deletion, and addition.  

3. **Frontend Module**  
   - Communicates with the backend to fetch and display tender data on a web page.  
   - Provides a **user-friendly interface** for interaction.
